I specialize in building WordPress sites and frontend design for web applications, and have experience with projects ranging from single-page websites to large eCommerce stores. Through my work, I have developed a strong understanding of the essential languages and concepts for frontend design.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I have proficiency in the Adobe Suite, aptitude for identifying and implementing solutions to diverse problems, ability to learn quickly, and excellent communication skills.
