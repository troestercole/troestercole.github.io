                                I had the opportunity to develop a website for Skydive Iowa, a company located just outside of Brooklyn, Iowa. The website was built using WordPress, with the "Salient" theme and WPBakery as the page builder. One of the main challenges I faced was creating compelling content for the website, given the limited information provided by the client. I had to conduct extensive research on skydiving practices, safety measures and the different types of jumps offered by Skydive Iowa in order to create informative and engaging text for the website.

                                In addition to the design and content, I also made sure that the website was fully responsive and optimized for search engines, to ensure that it would rank well in search results and be easily discoverable by potential customers.

                                I was fortunate enough to mentor a junior developer during the website development process for Frontier Lawns. The client was a pleasure to work with as they had a well-established brand with a powerful logo and a consistent color palette. They also provided us with high-quality images which helped to enhance the overall design of the website.

                                The project was not only a great opportunity for me to improve my teaching and mentoring skills, but also to gain valuable experience in designing and creating engaging content for landing pages. I was able to work with the junior developer to ensure that they understood the importance of design elements such as typography and layout. I also helped them to understand the importance of creating clear and concise content for landing pages to improve the user experience and increase conversions.

                                Working on the website for Ozegovic Homes was a straightforward task. I aimed for a modern and sleek design that would complement the contemporary architectural style of the homes that the client builds. The website's main purpose was to showcase the company's previous projects and encourage potential customers to get in touch. To achieve this, I created a simple navigation menu, included high-quality images of the homes and made sure that the contact information was prominently displayed on the site. It was a great project that allowed me to flex my design and development skills while creating a website that effectively represents the client's brand and business.

                                Developing the website for Catt.org was one of the most enjoyable and rewarding projects I have worked on in my career. I was given the opportunity to visit the historical home and museum associated with the organization, which provided me with a deeper understanding and appreciation for the women's suffrage movement and one of its key leaders.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The client gave me a lot of creative freedom when it came to designing the website, and I was able to incorporate elements that reflect the historical significance of the organization and the prairie landscape surrounding the home. One of the highlights of this project was the opportunity to mentor and train another developer, particularly in the areas of design and the use of WordPress and the Visual Composer page builder. It was a great opportunity for me to share my knowledge and experience, and to see the junior developer grow and develop their skills.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Overall, working on the Catt.org website was a fantastic learning experience that allowed me to combine my passion for design and history with my technical skills. It was a project that I am truly proud of and that has left a lasting impression on me.
