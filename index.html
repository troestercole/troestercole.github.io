                        <p>
                            I am a self-taught web developer from Waterloo, Iowa, with four years of professional experience as a freelancer. I specialize in building WordPress sites and frontend design for web applications, and have experience with projects ranging from single-page websites to large eCommerce stores. Through my work, I have developed a strong understanding of the essential languages and concepts for frontend design.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I have proficiency in the Adobe Suite, aptitude for identifying and implementing solutions to diverse problems, ability to learn quickly, and excellent communication skills.

                                I developed a website for a company called Skydive Iowa, located outside Brooklyn, Iowa. The site was built using WordPress and the "Salient" theme, which utilized WPBakery as a page builder. The project was challenging as I had limited content to work with, and had to research skydiving practices in order to create a compelling website that would attract potential skydivers to choose Skydive Iowa.
